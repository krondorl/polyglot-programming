# Polyglot Programming

These are practice tasks based on multiple programming languages simultaneously.

## Inspiration

I was inspired by ThePrimeagen's course ["Polyglot Programming: TypeScript, Go, & Rust"](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/typescript-go-rust/) to start this repository.

## Language

TypeScript, Go, and Rust are currently in this repo, but I might add more languages later.
